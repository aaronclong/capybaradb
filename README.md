# Capybara DB

I want to learn about database so I am going to write my own in *go*.

I'm going to read this [pdf](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/fntdb07-architecture.pdf) and several other paper's that I will repost here. My goal is ultimately to learn more about this and explore a concurrency.

Like wise I plan to implement this with [MVCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control).
